<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A funny thing happened on the way to the opera 
… When attending the recent Metropolitan Opera HD Simulcast of Carmen, I 
happened to casually glance at the person sitting a seat away from me.&nbsp; I was 
surprised to see that it was Tito Capobianco, the world-renowned opera stage 
director.&nbsp; Being curious, after politely introducing myself, I asked him what he 
thought of&nbsp; the Carmen we had just seen.&nbsp; He said it was an excellent, creative 
production and that the two lead singers were superb.&nbsp; He applauds the 
Metropolitan Opera for the service it is providing for the public to see opera 
at its best.&nbsp; He did, however, find the love scenes a little too sensuous for 
his taste.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bobbie Pioli)</font></b></p>

Mark Sforzini, Artistic Director of St. Petersburg Opera Company, spoke on “The 
Essence of Opera” &nbsp;(How It Got Started). In his enthusiastic and engaging style 
he gave a detailed account of the origins of opera.&nbsp; The audience was able to 
follow opera’s development through the visual chart, expertly produced 
electronically by Ivan Zatkovich, a serious opera buff and technology guru. (Bill

creative production of Mozart’s romantic comic opera “Cosi fan tutte” at the 
Palladium.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sold out Sunday matinee performance the cast of young 
singers delighted the audience with their comic touches and singing&nbsp; The 
orchestra, under the baton of artistic director, Mark Sforzini, stayed&nbsp; true to 
Mozart’s quick paced musical score.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire company was enthusiastically

British stage director Robert Eyre.&nbsp; Amazing costumes and sets, brilliant 
choreography and choral excellence additionally enhanced the production.&nbsp; The

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Opera made a difference in the lives of the 
children … studying at the Royal Theater Boys &amp; Girls Club Art Academy in 
midtown St. Petersburg..&nbsp; Some&nbsp; students from the Academy had been chosen to 
perform in the chorus of&nbsp; “The Barber of St. Pete” production which was 
performed in June 2009 at the Largo Cultural Center.&nbsp; The production was 
sponsored by the Pinellas Opera League, in partnership with the St. Petersburg 
Opera Company and the Largo Cultural Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are&nbsp; excerpts from the&nbsp; 
letters recently received from the Director and Music Instructor of the Academy, 
attesting to the opera’s impact upon the children. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;“On behalf of our Academy 
I would like to thank the Pinellas Opera League for the opportunity it provided 
to our students to experience performing in a <i>real opera</i>: “The Barber of 
St. Pete’. ….</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This real life experience 
was an opportunity of a lifetime that will not soon be forgotten. The student 
performers have created a culture of appreciation and enthusiasm for opera at 
our Academy…&nbsp; This makes arts education relevant in today’s media glamour 
culture.”&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;“The most important 
aspect of the experience remains the obvious sense of achievement and self-value 
that these students received from their participation in the opera.&nbsp; It is as if 
they rubbed up against the tree of self-confidence and now carry with them the 
knowledge of who they are and who they can become.”&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Edited by Madeline
