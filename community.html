          <h2>St. Petersburg Opera</h2>
          <p>SPO proudly announces its <a href="http://stpeteopera.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=210&Itemid=150">TENTH season</a> for 2015-2016. It will include productions of <i>Carmen, The Abduction from the Seraglio, La Bohème, South Pacific,</i> and <i>Seasonal Sparkle</i>. Season ticket brochures are in the mail. If you did not receive one, please call our office and we’ll be happy to send one out to you.</p>
          <h3>Carmen</h3>
          <p>“Love is a gypsy’s child, it has never, ever, known a law; love me not, then I love you; if I love you, you’d best beware!”</p>
          <p>With these words and the sexy rhythms of the Habanera, Carmen begins seducing Don José, a hapless soldier who already has a sweet, country-girl fiancée. He should have been wary because it’s a fast ride to throwing it all away for Carmen. Enter Escamillo, the dashing bullfighter, and you get a love triangle with tragic consequences.</p>
          <p>Tickets for all SPO events can be obtained by calling 727-823-2040 or by visiting the SPO website, <a href="http://www.stpeteopera.org">www.stpeteopera.org</a></p>
          <p>We are working on organizing transportation for POL members and guests for the Sunday matinee (October 18) of Carmen. IF we get 14 participants, we can get a real bus.</p>
          <h2>Matinee Opera Players</h2>
          <p>The Matinee Opera Players give four to six performances each year. They do not perform an entire opera; rather, they perform arias from well-known operas and a few 
          well-known tunes. The entire cast consists of volunteers and the performances are free but donations are greatly appreciated. The next performance is at the Performing Arts Center, 4951 78th Ave., Pinellas Park. Dates and program to be announced.</p>
