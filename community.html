          <h2>Matinee Opera Players</h2>
          <p>The Matinee Opera Players give four to six performances each year. They do not perform an entire opera. Rather, they perform arias from well-known operas and a few well-known tunes. The entire cast consists of volunteers and the performances are free but donations are greatly appreciated. The next performance is Sunday, June 14, at 3:00 p.m. at the Performing Arts Center, 4951 78th Ave. Pinellas Park.</p>
          <h2>St. Petersburg Opera</h2>
          <p>Tickets for all SPO events can be obtained by calling 727-823-2040 or by visiting the SPO website, <a href="http://www.stpeteopera.org">www.stpeteopera.org</a></p>
          <h3>Puccini’s Last Opera: Preview to <i>Turandot</i></h3>
          <p>May Mornings and Evenings with the Maestro. The opera is an emotional storm swirling around a femme fatale as magnetic as she is ruthless. It’s the mind game of two implacable warriors, and it leads to collateral damage so shocking that Puccini himself struggled with the moral consequences. Join Maestro Sforzini as he presents this informative preview to St. Petersburg Opera Company’s highly-anticipated production of <i>Turandot</i>.</p>
          <p>Thursday, May 21, 2015 at 6:00 p.m. at the Music Gallery, 5990 Ulmerton Rd., Clearwater. Friday, May 22, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. at Opera Central, 2145 First Ave., S., St. Petersburg.</p>
          <h3>Bella Voce</h3>
          <p>St Petersburg Opera’s annual gala will be a celebration of ancient China, in honor of their upcoming production of <i>Turandot</i>. Opera Central will be lavishly decorated with exciting lighting effects, live plants and flowers, and stunning art. Kirk Ke Wang’s large paintings will adorn the walls. Gourmet dinner, dragon dancing, palace warriors, and a whole lot of fun. The entertainment will be planned by Maestro Mark Sforzini and will feature the cast of Turandot.</p>

          <h3>Live opera doesn’t end in March in Tampa Bay!</h3>
          <p>St. Petersburg Opera presents Puccini’s <i>Turandot</i> on June 5, 7, and 9 at the Palladium Theater. Three riddles separate ordinary men from marriage to Princess Turandot, but the penalty for answering incorrectly is death. A mysterious foreign prince answers the riddles correctly, but magnanimously offers Turandot a chance to back out of the wedding if she can guess his true identity by morning. No one in the kingdom will sleep while she tries to learn his name. Set in China, Puccini’s final opera will fill your heart with sumptuously powerful music performed by an international cast and splendid chorus and professional orchestra. Sung in Italian with English translations displayed above the stage.</p>
          <p>We are working on organizing transportation for POL members and guests for the Sunday matinee (June 7). IF we get 14 participants, we can get a real bus.</p>
