          <h2>Scholarship Updates</h2>
          <p>The Pinellas Opera League has formed a partnership with the Pinellas County School Board and has adopted the music class at Central Elementary. POL has made the initial donation of $150.00, (up to $500.00 yearly) to sponsor art work with classical music theme.<p>
          <p>The Pinellas Opera League has set up a $500.00 scholarship to benefit students of the opera workshop as a community partner with the St. Petersburg College Foundation.</p>
          <p>President Christina Alexander has won the “Peoples’ Choice Scholarship Award of Excellence” from the Eastern Educational Research Association for the three minute thesis competition sponsored by the University of Queensland in Australia.</p>
          <h3>The Mary Jo Bell Memorial Scholarship Fund</h3>
          <p>The goal of the fund, which is now at $500, is to advance the careers of aspiring opera students. Mary Jo was one of the major founders of the Pinellas Opera League and worked tirelessly to build the League, initiating many new programs. She started the first children’s opera in the area with the production of The Barber of St. Pete in collaboration with St. Petersburg Opera at the Largo Cultural Center. The cast included children from different schools and was attended by camp children and their parents. Mary Jo also was the founder of “Adventures In Opera”, a monthly program which ran for many years bringing in performing artists and speakers on opera topics. She set up the partnership between POL and Ruth Eckerd Hall so that we could use the board room for our monthly meetings. Please continue to remember Mary Jo by making donations to her fund.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>On Friday, April 10, Marcia Lork, our Vice President and Education Chairman visited our newly adopted Central Elementary School in Clearwater to whom we have recently given a $ 150 grant with the purpose to promote opera and classical music. Marcia had been invited to speak at the “YMCA After School Program” for one hour to students of ages 5 through 12 at the school. In telling about her experience Marcia writes “Gingerbread cookies and opera were a big hit.” She began with a question and answer period finding out the students’ knowledge of opera and classical music followed by showing a Disney cartoon “Willie The Operatic Whale.” Marcia showed them a German doll dressed in traditional costume and then presented the last act of the 2008 Met modern production of Hansel and Gretel. She then passed out the gingerbread cookies to end the program.</p>
