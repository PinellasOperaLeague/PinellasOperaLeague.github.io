          <h4>Easter Parade Luncheon</h4>
          <p>Our Easter parade was a huge success thanks to all those who wore their Easter bonnets with all the frills upon it. There were beautiful arrays of colors worn by all the participants. The soloist for the day, Alessandra Feliciano sang the Irving Berlin song “Easter Parade” as the members paraded around the room. The prize for the prettiest hat went to Patti Baldwin, who was in a yellow ensemble. The most creative prize went to Kathleen Masalski with her parasol.</p>
